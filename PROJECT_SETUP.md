## üîÑ Handling Earlier Releases

### Version Strategy
- **Keep all git history** - Shows project evolution transparently
- **Preserve v2.0.0 and v2.1.0 tags** - For historical reference
- **Clearly mark transition point** - In changelog and documentation
- **New package name** - `simplemdb/simplemdb` vs old `simple-mysqli/simple-mysqli`

### For Users on Earlier Versions

#### **Upgrading from v2.1.0 to v3.0.0**
```bash
# Old installation
composer require simple-mysqli/simple-mysqli:^2.1

# New installation  
composer require simplemdb/simplemdb:^3.0
```

**Changes required:** None! All v2.1.0 code works unchanged in v3.0.0.

**What you get:**
- 19 new data types
- 9 new column modifiers
- Intelligent migration system
- Enhanced security and validation
- Comprehensive documentation

#### **Upgrading from v2.0.0 to v3.0.0**
```bash
# Update composer.json
"simplemdb/simplemdb": "^3.0"
```

**Changes required:** Minimal - mainly migration system improvements.

#### **Migrating from Original Simple-MySQLi (v1.5.5)**
This requires a more significant migration as the projects have diverged substantially. See migration guide in documentation.

### Release Support Policy
- **v3.0.0+**: Active development and support
- **v2.1.0**: Security fixes only until mid-2025
- **v2.0.0**: End of life - upgrade recommended
- **v1.5.5 and earlier**: Use original Simple-MySQLi repository

### Git Tag Management
All existing tags remain in the repository for historical reference:
```bash
git tag -l
# v2.0.0 - Foundation release
# v2.1.0 - Transition release  
# v3.0.0 - SimpleMDB enterprise release
```

This setup positions SimpleMDB as a professional, enterprise-ready database toolkit that respects its origins while establishing its own identity.
