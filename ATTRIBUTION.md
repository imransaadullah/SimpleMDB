# Attribution & Project Evolution

## Original Work

This project evolved from the excellent **Simple-MySQLi** library by WebsiteBeaver:
- **Original Repository**: https://github.com/WebsiteBeaver/Simple-MySQLi
- **Original Author**: WebsiteBeaver
- **Original License**: MIT
- **Original Version**: 1.5.5 (September 2018)

## Project Evolution

**SimpleMDB** began as a fork of Simple-MySQLi but has evolved into a completely different project:

### Original Simple-MySQLi (2017-2018)
- Single file: `simple-mysqli.php`
- Basic MySQLi wrapper
- Simple query building
- Fetch methods and basic operations
- ~600 lines of code

### SimpleMDB v3.0.0 (2025)
- **Enterprise Database Toolkit**
- 25+ data types with comprehensive validation
- 9 advanced column modifiers
- Intelligent migration system with context awareness
- Advanced schema builder
- Security-first design with SQL injection prevention
- Comprehensive documentation
- ~4,000+ lines of code across multiple classes
